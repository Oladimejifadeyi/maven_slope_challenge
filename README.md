A one-page dashboard to help skiers find their ideal destination.

I came across the Maven Slope Challenge on Linkedin and I decided to participate. The task is to build a one-page interactive dashboard to help skiers find their ideal destination. My first approach was to understand and Identify the objective of the task, what information (values and amenities) do I want to communicate? what key performance indicators (KPIs) are important for skiers? 

Then I proceeded to my dashboard design using Looker/Google data studio. I made use of scorecards to show key performance indicators, a filter dropdown button to filter countries by continent, a geographical representation showing the country region and amount of resorts in each country, a bar chart showing the distribution of countries with the most amount of skiing resorts and a table sorted by price showing the resorts, locations, price and key amenities and values that can help determine skiers preference.
